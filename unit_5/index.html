		<h2>About Sarge</h2>
		<p>Sgt. Pepper is a two-year-old French bulldog who loves playtime! He likes interacting with humans especially, no matter what their age. Sarge, as he's called, has big ears, stumpy legs, and a wrinkly face. What's not to love? </p>
		<p>Sarge was born in rural Pennsylvania and now lives as an urbanite in Boston, MA. He lives with his human mom and dad. The city lifestyle is great for him and has found some great hobbies in the neighborhood:</p>
		<ul>	
			<li>chasing leaves and street trash blowing in the wind</li>
			<li>waiting outside the spin studio for women to pet him</li>
			<li>eating Fenway frank remnants off the sidewalk</li>
			<li>sleeping for hours after an exhausting walk around the block</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why play with Sarge?</h2>
		<p>Sarge is the coolest dog you'll ever meet. If you're sad, he'll cheer you up. If you're not sad, he'll still cheer you up. He'll grow your Instagram following. He'll eat whatever you don't want off your plate. He'll snort you to sleep. He even fetches. Sometimes.</p>
